This project aims to analyse daily sentiment swings of tweet headlines from three major business news providers:
- Forbes
- Business Insider
- Yahoo Finance

The most recent 70 tweets (from 11:30, Nov. 24 2024) are analysed using the sentiment-analysis model (huggingface) and plotted on a graph to highlight the discrepancies and sentiment swings.
